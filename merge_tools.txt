Three categories of merge tools:

•   Dedicated tools like kdiff3 (http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)
    -   You can integrate this with the command line by
        declaring it as your merge tool in the global git config 
        (assuming kdiff3 is on your PATH):

            $ git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
        
        and then running the following whenever you encounter a merge conflict
            $ git mergetool

•   Tools included as part of a Git visualisation suite like
    GitKraken (http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/)

•   Tools included as part of an IDE like IntelliJ
